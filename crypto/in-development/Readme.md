## Solution:

`cmd = 'perl ./PadBuster/padBuster.pl {}\?data\={} {} 16 -encoding 1 --error "Padding Incorrect"'`
## Explanation:

When we visit the provided link, we can see that the website has two endpoints: `/encrypt` and `/decrypt`.

After visiting the `/encrypt` endpoint, we can see that server is returning a ciphertext in lowercase hexadecimal format. After refreshing the page multiple times, we can see that the ciphertext is not changing, so we only have one ciphertext.

After visiting the `/decrypt` endpoint with GET request, we can see that the server is returning a `400 Bad Request` error, and the implying that the server is expecting a ciphertext in `data` parameter.

After sending some random data to the `/decrypt` endpoint, we can see that the server is returning an error message is `PKCS#7 Padding Incorrect`. This error message is a hint that the server is using a padding scheme that is vulnerable to a padding oracle attack.

We can use the [PadBuster](https://github.com/AonCyberLabs/PadBuster) tool to perform a padding oracle attack on the server. The `PadBuster` tool is a Perl script that can be used to exploit padding oracle vulnerabilities.

We can use the following command to perform the padding oracle attack:

```bash
$ perl ./PadBuster/padBuster.pl http://challenge.sucyber.club:32102/decrypt\?data\=CIPHERTEXT_HERE {} 16 -encoding 1 --error "Padding Incorrect"
```

`-encoding 1` is used to specify that the ciphertext is in lower-case hexadecimal format.

`16` is used to specify the block size.

`--error "Padding Incorrect"` is used to specify the error message that is returned by the server when the padding is incorrect.

After running the command, we can see that the tool is able to decrypt the ciphertext and extract the plaintext.

The flag is `SUCTF{cbc_sux}`.
